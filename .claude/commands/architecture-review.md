# Architecture Review

## Review Objectives
Evaluate system architecture for scalability, maintainability, security, and performance.

## Architecture Review Checklist

### 1. System Design
- [ ] Overall architecture pattern (monolith, microservices, serverless)
- [ ] Component boundaries and responsibilities
- [ ] Data flow and system interactions
- [ ] Integration patterns and APIs

### 2. Scalability and Performance
- [ ] Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identification
- [ ] Caching strategies (application, database, CDN)
- [ ] Load balancing and traffic distribution

### 3. Security Architecture
- [ ] Authentication and authorization design
- [ ] Data protection and encryption
- [ ] Network security and access controls
- [ ] Compliance and regulatory requirements

### 4. Data Architecture
- [ ] Database design and data modeling
- [ ] Data consistency and integrity
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Data migration strategies

### 5. Technology Stack
- [ ] Technology choices and justification
- [ ] Dependency management
- [ ] Third-party service integrations
- [ ] Technical debt assessment

### 6. Operational Concerns
- [ ] Monitoring and observability
- [ ] Deployment and CI/CD strategy
- [ ] Error handling and resilience
- [ ] Documentation and knowledge transfer
